What I learned about Networking.
[[Raspberry Pi]][[Hacking]][[Linux]]
* DNS = Domain Name System is the phoneook of the internet
* WAN = Wide Area Network
* DDNS = Dynamic Domain Name System (an easy way to differentiate between the two is to simply remember that “**DNS** is to STATIC IP addresses while **DDNS** is to DYNAMIC IP addresses.”)
* LAN = Local Area Network
* IPv4 = **IPv4** stands for Internet Protocol version 4. It is the underlying technology that makes it possible for us to connect our devices to the web. Whenever a device accesses the Internet, it is assigned a unique, numerical **IP address** such as 99.48.
* IPv6 = **IPv6** (Internet Protocol version 6) is the sixth revision to the Internet Protocol and the successor to IPv4. It functions similarly to IPv4 in that it provides the unique IP addresses necessary for Internet-enabled devices to communicate.
* IPv4 vs IPv6 What are the main differences between IPv4 and IPv6?

**KEY DIFFERENCE**  
  
**IPv4** is 32-Bit IP address whereas **IPv6** is a 128-Bit IP address. **IPv4** is a numeric addressing method whereas **IPv6** is an alphanumeric addressing method. **IPv4** binary bits are separated by a dot(.) whereas **IPv6** binary bits are separated by a colon(:)
* ICMP = Internet Control Message Protocol.
* TCP = Transmission Control Protocol 
* DHCP = Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
* UDP = User Datagram Protocol
